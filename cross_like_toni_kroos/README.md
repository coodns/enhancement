# Cross Like Toni Kroos

This project is named **"Cross Like Toni Kroos"**.
Just like Toni Kroos delivers quick and precise crosses in football, this project contains code that allows fast and easy cross-account access to other AWS accounts.
## Getting Started

> **⚠️ Attention: All steps below assume the use of the Poetry program. Therefore, the Poetry plugin is required for this project. ⚠️**
>
>Please ensure Poetry is installed and configured before proceeding with any development steps. Without Poetry, the following commands and processes will not work as intended.

To begin development, ensure you have created a virtual environment using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). Once the virtual environment is ready, you can access it by running:

```bash
chmod +x util/activate
source util/activate
```

This command activates the virtual environment, allowing you to seamlessly work within the project’s environment.
